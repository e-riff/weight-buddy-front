# Weight Buddy – Frontend

This repository contains the frontend of **Weight Buddy**, a simple web application to track body weight over time.

The goal of the project is to provide a clean, lightweight interface to:
- log weight entries
- visualize progress using charts
- keep the user experience simple and distraction-free

## Tech stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Chart.js
- Pico.css

## Philosophy

This project intentionally avoids over-engineering:
- no router (single-page app)
- no heavy state management
- minimal dependencies
- focus on readability and maintainability

The frontend communicates with a separate backend API.

## Status

🚧 Work in progress – early stage
